-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Lab Assignment - Part 1
Review through the __Comparable and Comparator Interface__ lesson.  Implement the code in `Student.java` such that it works with `StudentDriver.java`. Complete StudentDriver coding that satisfy the following specifications.

- Comparable interface uses the student ID for comparison. This is a default comparsion, so-called natural ordering.
- Comparator interfaces use every one of instance variables. You have to implement __four Comparator classes__ for three instance variables and additionally one for comparing objects for the length of name.
- Add the definitions of `four` Comparator classes in `StudentDriver.java` provided with this Lab. There will be a penalty of -2 points for this violation. Why?

## Lab assignment - Part 2

Review this __Comparator with Lambda expression__ lesson and add the following two sorts and test them.  

- Use a lambda expression to sort the group by each instance variable.
- Use a lambda expression to sort the group by the student name length.
- Add this part of code at the end of StudentDriver.java

## Files to submit:
- Student.java
- StudentDriver.java     <--- (Original Code given + Your Part 1 & 2 Code)
